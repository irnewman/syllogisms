# syllogisms

A package to automate creation of syllogism stimuli lists for psychology experiments.

# Current State

Some functions are still unfinished, I would advise against trying to use the package currently. The documentation will be updated soon, as will completion of all the necessary functions and templates for a working version of the package. Improvements will follow incrementally. Please contact Ian at ian.newman@usask.ca if you have questions.
